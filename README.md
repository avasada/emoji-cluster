# emoji-cluster

This project was my first ever machine learning experiment. I created an AI that learned the difference between different emoji and was able to group similar emoji into categories by calculating the distance between high-dimensional vectors. Through this project I learned about embedding and executing the kmeans clustering algorithm. 

In order to run this sproject download the onlyemo_model.txt and the emoji_lookup.csv as well as the kmeans.py program. Running the kmeans.py program should take around one minute. Enjoy!
